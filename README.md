# Cat API Memory Game

This project is a memory game built using React, where players match pairs of random cat images fetched from the Cat API. It utilizes modern JavaScript tooling with Vite for fast development and production builds.

## Major Functions

- **Fetching Cat Images**: Random cat images are fetched from the Cat API using `fetch`.
- **Shuffling Cards**: Cards are shuffled at the beginning of the game and after each game round.
- **Flipping Cards**: Players can flip cards to reveal the cat images.
- **Matching Logic**: When two cards are flipped, the game checks if they match based on their names.
- **Game Completion**: A winner modal is displayed when all pairs are matched.
